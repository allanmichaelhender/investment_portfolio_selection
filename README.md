Welcome to my looking into investment portfolios and various investment methods and practices. This project was born out of curiosity to see the best investment practices for myself and to test ideas and questions many take for granted.

The analysis is split into two parts:
1 - Diverse Portfolios - with Stocks (in S&P 500 and/or World Index Tracker ETF), bonds and cash.
2 - World Indicies - focusing on Equity only via 4 Major World indicies.

Findings on to topic of Investment frequency are shown in the pdf: Investment Frequency Power BI
