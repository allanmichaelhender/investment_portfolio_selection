Welcome to my project looking into investment portfolios and various investment methods and practices. This project was born out of curiosity to see the best investment practices for myself and to test ideas and questions many take for granted.

The analysis and simulations are split into two parts:
1 - Diverse Portfolios - with Stocks (in S&P 500 and/or World Index Tracker ETF), bonds and cash.
2 - World Indicies - focusing on Equity only via 4 Major World indicies.

Findings on Investment Frequency, Portfolio Allocation, and Yearly Rebalancing are collated in the Power BI Dashboard PDF.
